                I’m <strong>Emily Stevens</strong> and I’m a junior at the Early College at Guilford.  I’m a <em>competitive swimmer</em> for 
                Star Aquatics and a <em>team captain</em> for the Western Guilford High School varsity swim team.  The ongoing pandemic has 
                shown me that more than anything, I need to be <strong>flexible</strong> in planning and to seize opportunities.  
            </p>
            <p class = "myactions">
                When the pandemic hit, I was <em>swimming every afternoon</em> with a large group of teammates, so that had to stop abruptly.
                I was <em>volunteering</em> at the Greensboro Science Center, a service activity that I have been unable to participate in 
                for an entire year.  I was going to school, <em>preparing for advanced placement exams.</em>  Suddenly, to protect the health
                and safety of myself and others, I was not allowed to leave my house for multiple months.  This pandemic <strong>forced</strong>
                me to make decisions for myself and others that could potentially prevent lives of individuals—strangers—from being at risk.  
                I have become stronger both physically and mentally because of this pandemic.  During this <strong>crucial</strong> stage of 
                development in my life, I have managed to become a better person.

            <img src="images/olaf.png" title ="Olaf the Snowman">
            I have always loved Olaf because he remains happy throughout his entire story, and wants the best for his friends, regradless 
            of what he will recieve in return.  He chooses to help others, even if it means dying, and even though he is lonely, he keeps 
            a smile on his face to help others remain positive.

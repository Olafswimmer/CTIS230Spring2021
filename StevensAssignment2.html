				This Is Me!
			</h1>
			<h2>
				Look Out Cuz Here I Come
			</h2>
			<p>
				I’m <strong>Emily Stevens</strong> and I’m a junior at the Early College at Guilford.  I’m a <em>competitive swimmer</em><br> for Star Aquatics and a <em>team captain</em> for the Western Guilford High School varsity swim team.  The <br>ongoing pandemic has shown me that more than anything, I need to be <strong>flexible</strong> in planning and to seize<br> opportunities.  When the pandemic hit, I was <em>swimming every afternoon</em> with a large group of <br>teammates, so that had to stop abruptly.  I was <em>volunteering</em> at the Greensboro Science Center, a service<br> activity that I have been unable to participate in for an entire year.  I was going to school, <em>preparing for <br>advanced placement exams.</em>  Suddenly, to protect the health and safety of myself and others, I was not <br>allowed to leave my house for multiple months.  This pandemic <strong>forced</strong> me to make decisions for myself<br> and others that could potentially prevent lives of individuals—strangers—from being at risk.  I have <br>become stronger both physically and mentally because of this pandemic.  During this <strong>crucial</strong> stage of <br>development in my life, I have managed to become a better person.

				Marching On to the Beat I Drum
			</h2>
			<p>
				When the pandemic hit, I <strong>could have</strong> chosen to disobey the orders of Governor Cooper and <br><em>continued hanging out</em> with friends and not abiding by his guidelines, but I <strong>chose</strong> to stay home and do <br>my part to help others.  I also decided to begin <em>working harder at building more physical strength</em> while I <br>was being pushed to the limits mentally.  I began <em>training</em> more aggressively for the sport of ninja.  With<br> the help of my mom, I <em>built a ninja course</em> in my backyard and was able to become stronger without<br> a gym or fitness facility.  The virus helped to <em>begin my ninja career</em> and make <strong>me</strong> the strongest I have ever<br> been and <strong>changed my mental perspective</strong> about the lockdown.  I <strong>could have</strong> thought about the <br>pandemic as a time that ruined my year and caused me to miss out on crucial parts of my life, but I <br><strong>chose</strong> a different route.  Instead, the pandemic was a time for me to get back on the path I was meant <br>to take and become a better person, in life and in sports.  The pandemic gave me the time I needed to <br><em>“get back on my feet”</em> after a tough year and begin bounding toward my future.

				Breaking Through the Barricade
			</h2>
			<p>
				Now, I have managed to <strong>break through</strong> my sluggish, depressed state and become someone that<br> I am beginning to be proud of.  I have managed to <em>focus</em> on my schoolwork and my athletics better since <br> something clicked in quarantine and I physically feel the most fit and the best I have ever felt.  Now that<br> we are starting to<em>escape</em>  the confinements of our homes to begin doing some social events and <br>gatherings, I am able to <em>walk out</em> of my house confidently, knowing how much of a better individual <strong>I <br>have become</strong> since March 12, 2020.

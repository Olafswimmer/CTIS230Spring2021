            Now, I have managed to <strong>break through</strong> my sluggish, depressed state and become someone that I am beginning 
            to be proud of.  I have managed to <em>focus</em> on my schoolwork and my athletics better since something clicked in 
            quarantine and I physically feel the most fit and the best I have ever felt.  Now that we are starting to <em>escape</em> 
            the confinements of our homes to begin doing some social events and gatherings, I am able to <em>walk out</em> of my house 
            confidently, knowing how much of a better individual <strong>I have become</strong> since March 12, 2020.

            <strong>Rex</strong>

        <p class = "characters">
            <img src="images/rex.png" title ="Rex the Dino Toy">
            Rex has always been a character that I love simply because of his energetic personality.  Even though he is not the favorite, 
            and is not always played with, he holds his head up and does all he can to help the other toys.  He is a fun character that 
            always looks for the best in others, but is also very protective of his friends.  Although he is a t-rex, he does not let that 
            define him and is a good guy.
